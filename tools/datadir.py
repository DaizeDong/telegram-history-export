"""datadir -- where a skill's REAL-RUN OUTPUT goes. Never the repo.

These skills already had a private-companion-config boundary, and it worked. But it only ever
covered INPUTS: the credentials, the mailboxes, the account slugs. Nothing covered OUTPUTS -- what
the skill LEARNED from a real run. So a forward-tracking tool appended the operator's actual research
verdicts (one row per decision, hundreds of them) to a git-tracked `metrics/*.jsonl`, and another
skill's ledger recorded what was bought and where it shipped -- straight into public repos, on every
run, by design.

No content scanner catches that. There is no email in it, no phone, no ZIP. It is just the
operator's life, correctly formatted. The fix is not a better sieve, it is a pipe that does not
point at the public repo in the first place.

  resolve_data_dir("small-cap-deepdive")  ->  the private directory, or None

Discovery order (first existing wins):
  1. $<SKILL>_DATA_DIR                       explicit override / hot-swap
  2. $<SKILL>_CONFIG / $<SKILL>_CONFIG_DIR   the PRIVATE COMPANION REPO, wherever it is pinned:
                                             <config>/data/ when that exists, else <config> itself
  3. ~/.<skill>-config/data/                 the same companion repo at its default dotfile path
  4. ~/.<skill>-data/                        standalone fallback
  5. None                                    -> the tool is UNINITIALIZED, which is exactly what a
                                                freshly cloned public skill SHOULD be

WHY STEP 2 EXISTS (added 2026-07-31)
------------------------------------
Every skill in this fleet already resolves its private companion repo from `$<SKILL>_CONFIG`, and
several of those repos have been pinned somewhere other than the dotfile path (`$MARKET_INTEL_CONFIG`
and `$DAILY_HOTSPOTS_CONFIG` both point into ~/CodesClaude). This resolver did not know that, so it
looked only at the dotfile path, found nothing, and answered None -- "uninitialized" -- for skills
that were writing a real ledger every day. An out-of-band control then asked THIS function where the
data was, got None, and reported the skill as nothing-to-check. A checker that is told nothing
reports a clean sheet, which is the failure mode the whole data boundary exists to avoid. The
resolver now follows the same pointer the skill itself follows.

PRIVATE COMPANION REPO IS THE DESTINATION, NOT AN ACCIDENT
----------------------------------------------------------
Real-run output LIVES IN the private companion repo, versioned and backed up like everything else
there. The rule was never "data must not be in git" -- it is "data must never be in a PUBLIC repo,
and a public repo never has an in-repo fallback". Those are different predicates and conflating them
condemns the correct shape: a private repo is exactly where a person's real data legitimately lives.

WHY THIS FILE DOES NOT CHECK VISIBILITY ITSELF
----------------------------------------------
The tempting next step is to have this function refuse a data dir that sits in a PUBLIC repo. It
cannot do that honestly. This file is vendored into every public skill repo, is stdlib-only by
contract, and has to work on a fresh clone on a stranger's machine: no ~/.pii-guard/visibility.json,
no `gh`, possibly no network. Fail-closed there bricks every fresh clone on a question that has no
local answer; fail-open makes the assertion decorative precisely where it matters. So the visibility
predicate stays OUT OF BAND, in the fleet checker that does have the map.

What this file CAN assert with no map, no network and no git binary is strictly weaker and always
true: a skill's data dir is never inside the skill's OWN repo. Public or private, the tool repo and
the companion repo are two different repos, and a data dir that resolved into this one is either an
in-repo fallback or a misconfigured pointer -- the exact shape that put a real SEC contact email in
a public repo under the label "legacy fallback". That one is checked here, and it raises.

`data_path()` raises a DataDirNotInitialized with instructions rather than silently falling back to a
path inside the repo. A silent in-repo fallback is how this happened: `reference/config.json` was the
documented "legacy fallback", and the operator's real SEC contact email ended up committed in it.
A fallback into the repo is not a convenience, it is the leak.

Vendored into each skill as `tools/datadir.py`. Stdlib only.

    Every companion repo in this fleet already follows this. Nothing looked for it, and that

    the answer to "where is this skill's data" depended on whether someone had remembered to
    export a variable on this particular machine.

    Measured 2026-08-20 across eight skills that have real data:
      resolved to the companion repo   3   (their env var happened to be set)
      resolved to a $HOME dotfile      3   (one of them WHILE its companion repo sat beside it)
      answered "uninitialized"         3   (one of those had 153 tracked files in its companion)
    The last group is the bad one: `datadir.py` returned None, callers correctly reported the
    skill as having no data, and an out-of-band coverage check counted them as SKIP. Three real
    private repos were invisible to the boundary tooling, and the report was green.

    Derived from this file's own worktree rather than a hardcoded path, deliberately. The
    absolute location differs per machine, and a home-anchored literal in a public repo is
    exactly what pii_guard blocks. When this file is NOT inside a worktree (the canonical copy
    under the scripts directory), there is no sibling to infer and this contributes nothing;
    resolution then falls back to the env vars and dotfiles as before.

    IT EXISTS SO THERE IS ONE DISCOVERY ORDER, NOT TWO. One skill in this fleet carried a second

    files into its own public repository. Two answers to one question, and the wrong one was the one
