"""pii_guard -- keep real-world identifiers out of a public repo. Structural, allowlist-based.

WHY THIS EXISTS (read before changing it)
-----------------------------------------
These repos are authored by an agent that is simultaneously looking at the operator's real private
data. When it needs an example, the nearest example is that real data. In 2026-07 that produced real
PII in several public repos across a range of categories -- contact details, a home location, an
employer name, a health-provider name, a social handle, and the operator's private machine paths
(a home dir / a hardcoded ~/.<tool> script path) baked into the CODE of a public tool -- plus the
operator's real email stamped on the author line of nearly every commit. (The categories are named
here only to show the guard's coverage; the specifics belong to the operator and are deliberately
kept out of this file.)

Each of those was "fixed" at the time by editing the offending FILE. The working tree went clean and
the commit that introduced it stayed on GitHub forever. That is the failure this guard exists to make
structurally impossible:

  1. A DENYLIST CANNOT WORK. It is written by the same author who leaks, so it only ever blocks what
     that author already thought of. The 2026-07 leak was a vendor the denylist had never heard of.
     Worse: a denylist of real identifiers IS a PII document -- committing it to the public repo is
     itself the leak. So this guard is an ALLOWLIST: it flags every real-world-shaped identifier that
     is not from the declared synthetic namespace, including vendors nobody anticipated. It contains
     no private data and is safe to publish.

  2. HISTORY IS PART OF THE ARTIFACT. Scanning only `git ls-files` is why every previous "fix" left
     the leak live in an old commit. `--history` scans every blob, every commit message, and every
     author/committer line reachable from any ref.

  3. THE GATE MUST BE AT THE PUSH BOUNDARY. A test only fails if someone remembers to run it, and a
     `pytest && git push` chain can mask the failure. The pre-push hook fails closed.

ESCAPE HATCH
------------
Real third-party identifiers are sometimes the legitimate content of a repo (a vendor's public
sender address that a parser must recognize). Put those in a repo-local `.pii-allow`, one literal per
line with a `# reason`. That is an allowlist entry with a written justification -- reviewable in the
diff, unlike a silent regex tweak.

OPTIONAL PRIVATE LAYER (rebuilt 2026-08-20; see THE POLICY LAYER below for the full argument)
----------------------
If `~/.pii-denylist.json` exists it is read at runtime for extra literals (the operator's own real
tokens). It never lives in any repo. Absent -> skipped and SAID OUT LOUD, structural checks still
run everywhere (CI, contributors, other machines).

That layer used to be a flat list of strings with one punishment, and it had two faults that were
not bugs but consequences of the shape:

  RETROACTIVE VIOLATIONS. Private repo names were added to the list automatically, so creating a
  repo turned prose written before it existed into a finding, in history, where the only remedy on
  offer was a rewrite. Fixed by giving tokens a KIND and letting the scan DOMAIN decide the force:
  irreversible identifiers keep full jurisdiction, topology gates live content and is reported as
  debt in history. No dated ledger is involved, because the question is never asked.

  AUTOMATIC GROWTH. The single most common act here, giving a public skill a private companion
  named `<skill>-config`, added a token -- for a string any reader can reconstruct from the public
  name plus a convention these repos publish themselves. Fixed by admitting such names as
  `derived`: reported, never gating. Measured on the live map: 11 of 18 (61%) stop being
  enforcement material.

The loader now also proves it worked before anything is called clean: a canary it asserts is
present, a count it compares, and a probe that the matcher can still say yes. Anything it cannot
verify raises and exits 2, because an unverifiable policy is an absent scan wearing a green light.

USAGE
  python pii_guard.py --tree               # fast: git-tracked working tree (pre-commit)
  python pii_guard.py --tree --history     # full: + every blob/message/author in history (pre-push)
  python pii_guard.py --tree --history --repo /path/to/repo
  python pii_guard.py grant --token X --scope history-only --reason "..." \
      --nonce <printed at the block>
Exit 0 = no blocking findings. Note that 0 does NOT mean silence: HISTORY-DEBT and WARN lines are
         printed on a passing run and the summary refuses to say "clean" while any are outstanding.
         The hooks print the guard's output unconditionally for exactly this reason.
     1 = a blocking finding (prints file:line and what tripped it).
     2 = the scan could NOT be performed: git unusable, not a work tree, or the private policy
         could not be trusted. Never confuse 2 with 0: see _run and PolicyError for the two
         fail-opens this replaced.
Stdlib only.

# for and waved straight through. Two shapes, both enforced against tree AND history (a breach):
#
# HARD (USER-PATH): a real account name in a home path -> reveals the operator's username; never
#   legitimate. `C:\Users\<name>`, `/home/<name>`, `/Users/<name>` for a non-generic <name>.
# The separator run is `\\{1,4}` and not a single backslash, which was a real miss: a Windows
# home path is written with DOUBLED backslashes everywhere it passes through a string literal --
# every settings.json, every non-raw Python or JS source line, every JSON config. Measured
# 2026-08-20: the single-backslash form was caught and `C:\\\\Users\\\\<name>\\\\...` was missed
# entirely, in the category the 2026-07 audit found leaking MOST. Four allows for one more
# level of escaping (a path inside a JSON string inside another JSON string, which is how a

#   a real personal identifier   irreversible, no legitimate public use, must never have existed
#   a private repo NAME          reveals topology, and CRUCIALLY it HAS A DATE OF BIRTH
#   a real proper noun           has legitimate public uses; only private in context
# Applying "block everywhere including all of history" to the second class is what produced
# retroactive violations: a sentence written BEFORE a repo existed became a finding on the day
# that repo was created, and the only remedy on offer was rewriting history over a name. So a
# token now carries a `kind`, and the scan DOMAIN decides the force:
#
#     kind          tree/staged/range        history
#     secret        BLOCK                    BLOCK
#     linkage       BLOCK                    DEBT   (reported and counted, does not gate)
#     derived       WARN                     WARN
#
# Note what this buys with no dated bookkeeping at all: content written before a token existed
# can only ever be a linkage or derived hit in HISTORY, and neither gates there. No first-seen
# ledger, no clock comparison, no human adjudicating which old lines deserve amnesty. The
# ledger approach fails the moment its cache is rebuilt; this cannot, because it never asks
# the question. (Same jurisdiction split as GitHub push protection, which blocks new content
# and routes pre-existing findings to an alert surface, and as clean-as-you-code gating.)
#
# `secret` is the DEFAULT for anything unlabelled. A slip of the finger lands on the strict
# side; only an explicit declaration relaxes anything.
#
# IDEA 2 -- A TOKEN THAT ANYONE CAN DERIVE FROM PUBLIC FACTS IS NOT A SECRET.
# The old layer added every private repo name automatically, so the denylist grew each time a
# repo was created, and each new entry retroactively condemned old prose. But this fleet names
# a private companion `<public-repo>-config`, and that convention is DOCUMENTED IN THE PUBLIC
# REPOS THEMSELVES. Given the public name, anyone can write down the private one. Its marginal
# information is zero, and treating it as a secret means paying a history rewrite for a string
# that discloses nothing. So:
#
#     derivable(t)  <=>  exists a PUBLIC repo p under the same owner, and a documented
#                        suffix c, such that t == p + c
#
# Derivable names are admitted as `derived` (reported, never gating). Everything else keeps
# full `linkage` force. This is what stops the automatic growth at the source: the single most
# common act on this machine, giving a public skill a private companion, now adds nothing.
# Measured against the live visibility map on 2026-08-20: 11 of 18 cross-repo tokens (61%)
# are derivable and stop being enforcement material.
#
# The direction matters and is preserved: if the PARENT is private too, the child name is NOT
# derivable from anything public, and it stays `linkage`.

# `derived` is the one verdict in this guard that RELAXES something, and its entire justification is
# a claim about the outside world: "the parent repo is public, so this name discloses nothing". That
# claim comes from the visibility map, and a claim has an age. Measured 2026-08-20 while reviewing
# this design: a map stamped five years ago still granted the downgrade, and the output said nothing
# about the map at all. A blocking linkage finding silently became a non-blocking WARN because of a
# file nobody had looked at. That is the same shape as every defect this redesign removed, pointing
# the permissive way, introduced by the redesign itself.
#
# Two thresholds, because the two failures are different sizes:
#   NOTE   the refresher runs every 4 hours, so a day-old map means it has missed about six runs.
#          Worth saying, not worth gating: nothing is wrong with the verdicts yet.
#   MAX    30 days, deliberately the same number visibility_of.py uses for MAX_MAP_AGE_S and for the
#          same reason recorded there: seven days is shorter than a holiday, and a window nothing
#          renews is a time bomb with a documented fuse. Past it the map is not evidence any more,
#          so every name that WOULD have been `derived` stays `linkage` and keeps gating. Strict is
#          the safe direction here, and it is also what this guard did before derivability existed.

    can compute it without ever running a scan. It is therefore a TYPO BARRIER -- it pins a grant
