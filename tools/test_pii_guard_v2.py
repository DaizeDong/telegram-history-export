"""Tests for the v2 policy layer: token kinds, the jurisdiction matrix, derivability,
loader self-attestation, and the exemption exit.

READ THIS BEFORE ADDING A TEST HERE
-----------------------------------
Nearly every assertion below has a TWIN pointing the other way, and the twin is the point.
A test that only checks "the loader raises on a damaged file" is passed by a loader that
raises on everything; a test that only checks "linkage does not gate in history" is passed by
a guard that has stopped gating. So each relaxation is paired with the case that must still
block, and each fail-closed assertion is paired with a healthy input that must still pass.

Every identifier here is synthetic.
