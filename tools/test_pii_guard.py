# pii-guard:scanner-file -- this file must contain the shapes it detects; see SCANNER_MARKER
"""Tests for pii_guard.

The acceptance criterion is not "does it pass on clean input". It is: **would it have caught every
leak that actually reached a public repo on 2026-07-13?** Each one is a regression test below,
reconstructed from the real artifact -- but written with SYNTHETIC values.

That substitution is not a compromise, it is the proof: the guard is structural. It does not know
the operator's phone number, it knows the shape of a phone number that is not 555. So a fake number
of the same shape exercises exactly the same code path, and this test file -- unlike the denylist it
replaces -- carries no PII and is safe to vendor into every public repo. A test suite that had to
embed the real leaks to test for them would just be the leak again, one directory over.

The one thing that CANNOT be structural is a proper noun nobody anticipated -- an ordinary word
that happens to be a private name in this operator's life. That is what the optional private layer
is for, and it is tested through the mechanism, never through its contents.
