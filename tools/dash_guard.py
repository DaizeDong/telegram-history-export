# dash-guard:scanner-file -- this file carries the dash set by design; see _self_marker
"""dash_guard: flag / fix en-dash and em-dash used as prose in a public repo.

House rule (user global): published prose carries NO en/em dash. The ASCII hyphen `-` is left
ALONE (it is code syntax: identifiers, flags, file names, versions, URLs, ranges in code), so this
guard only touches the en-dash U+2013, em-dash U+2014 and horizontal bar U+2015. None of those
three ever appear in code SYNTAX, so every occurrence outside a code span is prose and is a target.

Modes (exactly one action):
  --check  (default) print every offending file:line; exit 1 if any (pre-commit / CI gate)
  --fix              rewrite the offending files in place. NOT a gate: see the note at the end of
                     main(). It exits 0 after a successful repair and 1 only for files it could not
                     read, so wiring --fix into CI would install a check that cannot fail.

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 findings (or, under --fix, unexaminable files), 2 the scan could not run at
all (git unusable / not a work tree). 2 must never be read as 0; see _git.

Target set:
  --staged           the git staged text blobs (pre-commit hook)
  --tree   (default) every git-tracked text file
  paths...           explicit files (overrides the set)

Markdown safety: fenced ``` code blocks and inline `code` spans are skipped, so a dash shown as a
literal example survives. In every other text file each en/em dash is treated as prose.

Replacement (deterministic):
  markdown table cell that is ONLY a dash  -> "none"  (the cell means "no value", not an aside)
  markdown table cell STARTING with a dash -> ASCII "-" (a sub-item marker, not an aside)
  spaced   ` — ` / ` – `                 -> ", "   (appositive / aside; never grammatically wrong)
  ASCII range  A–B  (word char both sides) -> "A to B"  (e.g. T1–T9, 2020–2026)
  any leftover run  —— / – / ―           -> "," glued to the preceding word (never " ,")

Why the table rules exist: a table cell holding a single long dash is the conventional way to write
"no default". Substituting punctuation there produced cells reading "," or ", something", which is
not prose at all, and NO gate can see it afterwards because the output contains no dash. The cell
rules run before the prose rules so a dash that is a value never reaches the appositive rule.

#           corrupted. Output/display strings are handled by the skill's runtime _inline normalizer,
#           not here.
#   "tmpl"  A generator template, processed as Markdown. This extension exists because a template is
#           the one file whose dashes are invisible twice over: the .tmpl suffix hid it from this map,
#           and the generator that expands it holds the rest of its prose in Python STRING literals,
#           which the "py" rule leaves alone by design. skill-smith therefore reported a clean tree
#           while its CONFIG.md.tmpl carried 22 dashes and every repo it scaffolded was born failing
#           the very gate it vendored. Markdown handling is the right rule even for a non-Markdown
#           template (a systemd unit, a gitignore): those carry no fences and no inline code spans, so
#           md degrades to plain prose on them, while a .md.tmpl keeps its fenced blocks protected.
# Any extension not listed is left completely alone (a mixed prose/data code file we cannot auto-edit
# safely). The rule is enforced on published docs + the .py comment prose; runtime output compliance
# is the renderer's job.
