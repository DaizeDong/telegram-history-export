"""load_budget: the mechanism behind PHILOSOPHY P7.

P7 says SKILL.md carries the RULE and its test while references carry the rationale, the signature
and the war-story, and that **the same sentence never appears in both**. That is a principle, and a
principle with no mechanism decays (P2: mechanisms, not intentions). This is the mechanism.

WHAT IT MEASURES
    SKILL.md is paid for on every invocation; reference docs are paid for only when read. So the
    number that matters is not repo size, it is:
      1. how many lines are always loaded, and
      2. how much of that is prose that ALSO lives in an on-demand reference.

    (2) is the real defect. Two copies drift, and the copy a future reader trusts is whichever one
    they happened to open. It is detected with word shingles: a run of N consecutive words appearing
    in both SKILL.md and a reference is duplicated prose, not a coincidence.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT FLAG
    Having many reference files. A directory of small, densely specific docs is healthy when each is
    loaded only by the run that needs it. The audit that motivated P7 went looking for bloat in a
    33-file tool directory and found layering instead. **Count what a run loads, not what the repo
    contains.**

    Short shared phrases. A rule's own wording legitimately appears in the reference that elaborates
    it. The shingle length is set so that only sustained prose overlap trips the gate.

EXIT CODES
    0  within budget
    1  over budget (used by hooks / CI)
    3  NOTHING WAS MEASURED. This is a failure, not a state.

WHY "NOTHING TO MEASURE" IS A FAILURE (and used to be a quiet success)
    This tool shipped knowing exactly one repo shape, skills/<name>/SKILL.md. Two repos in this
    fleet keep their single SKILL.md at the repo ROOT instead, and those two happen to hold the
    third and fifth largest always-loaded files on the machine. In both of them the tool printed
    "no SKILL.md found, nothing to measure" and exited 2, which the docstring itself blessed as
    "a state, not a failure". So the gate built to measure the always-loaded budget reported a
    clean, deliberate-looking result on the files most over that budget.
    That is the fleet's signature defect: a gate that reassures. Both halves are fixed here. The
    root layout is now discovered (see skill_md_paths), and finding nothing to measure exits 3,
    because a tool vendored into a skill repo that locates no skill has failed to do its job, no
    matter how calmly it says so. Exit code 2 is retired rather than redefined: a caller that
    special-cased 2 as benign must break loudly rather than keep quietly agreeing.
